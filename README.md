many things to do


## TODO

- [x] detect missing `__init__.py` (mypy)
- [ ] setup local dev-dependencies (pdm)
  - [x] null-ls detect pdm: flake8, autopep8 (null-ls)
  - [ ] null-ls too slow, need to save twice (null-ls, TODO-i)
- [x] auto switch python version (pyenv)


## ?
- if on-save fail: make sure `.python-version` exist
- global `pylsp` is needed: to detect sibling files
- local `autopep8` is needed: to lint based on project settings
